# ðŸ§ ðŸ¦€ BrainCrab
A Brainfuck CLI. My long term goal is to turn this into a toolchain for a programming language that compiles down to Brainfuck.

## Features
- Run .bf files
- A Brainfuck repl

## TODO
Here are my upcoming tasks.
- Refine repl, perhaps use crossterm or even ratatui?
- Start working on a new programming language on top of Brainfuck.
- Split off code from main.rs into separate files for tokenizer, parser and interpreter.
- A bf! macro that turns Brainfuck code into a runnable program at compile time.
