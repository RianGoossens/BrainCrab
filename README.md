# ðŸ§ ðŸ¦€ BrainCrab
A Brainfuck CLI. My long term goal is to turn this into a toolchain for a programming language that compiles down to Brainfuck.

## Features
- Run .bf files
- A Brainfuck repl

## TODO
Here are my upcoming tasks.
- Refine repl, perhaps use crossterm or even ratatui?

### Braincrab Language TODO
- Easier way to check if a value is the same as an address, and if it's temp
- Edge case for assigning to self (nop)
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulo
- Logical And
- Logical Or
- Logical Not
- Expressions
- Types? (u8, bool, structs, arrays...)
